// Currently, I'm pursuing a Level 5 Diploma in Web Development at Politeknik Brunei. When I'm not immersed in coding, you can find me cycling through scenic routes, diving into the captivating world of anime, or enjoying a good game. I also cherish spending quality time with friends. Balancing my passion for technology with a vibrant array of hobbies keeps me inspired and energized.
